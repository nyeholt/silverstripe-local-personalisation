user profile.

## Documentation


### Rules for profile segmentation

Rules are defined in the CMS 

They can be triggered for;

* A regex match against content


### Applying rules

It is up to you as a developer to apply these rules to content. The key aspects

* add the lp-item css class 
* Add the 'data-lp-tags' attribute to list (comma separated) the tags applied on the profile
  to trigger this element
* Add the data-lp-type attribute to indicate whether to "show" (default) or "hide" the element 
* Add the data-lp-times attribute (optional) to indicate how many times the user's profile 
  has to have been tagged 
* Add the data-lp-timeframe attribute to indicate what timeframe (ie -1 week) the tagging
  must have happened


```

<div class="this-thing lp-item" data-lp-tags="route-detail" data-lp-times="5" data-lp-type="hide">
    <h1>What this is</h1>
</div>

```


## Events

The following events are triggered and can be responded to in custom code

* local_profile_match_tag
* local_profile_apply_rule
* local_profile_add_tag

Bind to these as `document.addEventListener('local_profile_add_tag', function (eventData) {})`
